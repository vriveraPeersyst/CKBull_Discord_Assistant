all right hello everyone it's great to
0:12
be here I'm so excited it's my first
0:15
time in Thailand but also it's First
0:17
Time nervos conference and I'm so
0:20
excited for this I've been uh
0:23
participating in many conferences over
0:25
the last years in in different
0:26
ecosystems and I'm very glad to see that
0:29
the nervos conference fce netor
0:31
conference has so much people even now
0:33
in the afternoon there's still a
0:35
significant amount of people here which
0:36
I think it's it's great so thanks
0:38
everyone for for joining and hopefully
0:40
my talk uh can um bring some insightful
0:44
ideas to all of you uh my presentation
0:48
uh today I'm going to talk about app
0:49
interfaces for a multi-chain wall as a
0:52
developers we are more in in in the side
0:55
here that we want to provide uh useful
0:58
user experiences
1:00
and interfaces for end users I've seen a
1:03
lot of interesting Technologies but
1:05
mostly in the infrastructure side today
1:07
and I think if all this technology it's
1:10
not provided efficiently to the end
1:12
users it's going to be lost or it's
1:14
going to not be used for anyone I think
1:16
this is something very important that
1:18
most developers think on this
1:20
underlaying part but it's very important
1:22
to bring it to the real uh Mass adoption
1:26
otherwise your efforts are not worth it
1:28
right so today I want to talk about
1:30
these four topics first of all I I will
1:32
make a quick intro on why we are on a
1:35
multi-chain wall and why it's likely
1:37
that we are becoming even more
1:39
multi-chain over the time this is
1:41
something that it's it's very unlikely
1:42
to change then we will see how this
1:45
multichain impacts uh the nervous
1:48
ecosystem right now today and then we
1:50
will try to provide some best practices
1:53
for all the app developers that wants to
1:55
start interacting with a variety of
1:57
infrastructures behind the scenes uh how
2:00
to provide the user experience uh for
2:02
your customers that they enjoy and they
2:04
stay then you can retain um their
2:07
participation so let's start um on why
2:11
we are a multi-chain wall and why it's
2:13
likely that we continue to become
2:15
multi-chain and even increasingly
2:17
multi-chain and actually multichain STS
2:21
uh back in the time around 2014 balic uh
2:25
butterin made this blog post on ethereum
2:28
and called on Sil
2:30
and this is why because at the very
2:32
early days most of the people small
2:35
community of developers were building on
2:36
bitcoin right and start suddenly couple
2:39
of people and groups started building
2:41
different chains started building
2:43
different projects instead of pouring
2:45
all the efforts on bitcoin and
2:48
blockstream uh which is it's one of the
2:51
early adopter companies proposed side
2:53
chains and proposed side chains as a
2:55
criticism for all these silos that were
2:57
being created that were not contributing
3:00
to a common infrastructure all building
3:03
for Bitcoin but instead people were
3:06
taking different silos and directions
3:08
and sa chains was a way to say okay if
3:10
everyone is going to build their own
3:12
thing at least let's use a common layer
3:15
of tokenomics which can be Bitcoin and a
3:17
common layer of security right so it it
3:19
was like an intent of pting things a
3:22
little bit together recognizing that
3:24
fragmentation was started to to come out
3:28
and so but still some of the Bitcoin
3:30
maximalist arguments by the time were
3:32
basically saying look building silos is
3:36
a dispers of efforts it's better if we
3:39
all work together there was not that
3:41
many developers at the time so if all of
3:43
us built on top of Bitcoin then that's
3:45
better than creating 20 different chains
3:48
right and they had this idea of One X to
3:51
rule them all so if if we all build on
3:53
bitcoin then we can create this Global
3:55
super computer that can facilitate all
3:57
all the transactions and payments so
3:59
then fragmentation includes that
4:01
fragmentation is rather
4:03
inevitable uh and then it's the only way
4:05
for the ecosystem to to move
4:09
forward so let's see why we fragment
4:12
first of all why we fragment we fragment
4:15
because we disagree um so the first
4:17
thing we can do is agree that we
4:18
disagree and we disagree in many ways
4:21
the first way is say that we disagree
4:23
and we disagree in many ways the first
4:26
way it's Technic uh it's probably we are
4:29
going to to use one infrastructure which
4:31
is probably very secure for chiz the
4:33
assets but at the same time we will need
4:35
another infrastructure for storing the
4:38
files and the images because uh other
4:41
blockchains are not good for that so for
4:43
example we may use filecoin and then for
4:46
identities we may use another blockchain
4:48
or for oracles for Price trading Etc
4:50
right so you can use a set of tools that
4:53
has to do their own incentives for
4:55
example in order to provide Oracle data
4:58
it's very interesting to have a toonomic
5:00
layer that it's incentivizing to slash
5:03
or reward people for providing reliable
5:06
data at the same time if you want to
5:08
tokenize uh an nft itself for example in
5:11
ethereum or any other chain you need to
5:13
provide tokenomics that incentivize
5:15
security and stake of this network or
5:18
proof of work but you have a a different
5:21
incentives here right so having all this
5:24
Sate basically the the conclusion here I
5:26
think it's very clear now it's plurality
5:28
of networks will succeed and that's a
5:30
good thing this will provide more um use
5:34
cases enabl it with blockchain
5:35
technology and since plurality of
5:37
networks will succeed then we will need
5:40
interoperability mechanism so we can
5:42
aggregate all these services and provide
5:44
uh very good user experiences or G apps
5:47
that uses the maximum power of This
5:49
Global supercomputer which is the union
5:51
of most of the
5:53
blockchains so let's see uh how this
5:56
impact the nervos ecosystem so the
5:58
nervos ecosystem started as a nervous
6:01
network but right now it's overlapping
6:03
and having interferences with many
6:06
different ecosystems and let's start
6:08
with nervos nervos network has huge
6:10
advantages it has a consensus mechanism
6:13
that provides a very secure reliable and
6:16
efficient uh use of resources we have a
6:19
powerful smart contract capabilities
6:21
combining the cell model uh together
6:24
with the risk B virtual machine uh for
6:26
enhanced utx model that has scaled uh
6:30
transactionality and programmability on
6:32
top of uh on top of other blockchains
6:35
and we have a very good toomics for the
6:37
long-term holding that also creates an
6:41
incentive for efficient use of resources
6:43
to create sustainable future for the
6:45
network and that's very good right on
6:48
the on the other side uh we are seeing
6:50
Bitcoin lining Network that has been a
6:52
very successful layer to scaling
6:54
solution for Bitcoin that basically
6:56
creates onchain payment channels that
6:59
opens channels that can create unlimited
7:01
amount of uh of chain transactions and
7:04
then these channels are closed so this
7:07
provides a very low latency and very low
7:09
fee transactionality in the middle it
7:12
has hash time lock contracts that
7:14
mitigate counterparty Risk by securing
7:16
funds and at the same time it has a
7:18
rooting mechanism that allows opening a
7:21
Channel with an indirect participant and
7:24
finding a path in order to M this
7:27
transactionality as an inspiration of
7:30
these two we have right now and we've
7:32
seen recently the fiber Network the
7:35
fiber network is a very Noble uh
7:37
layering on top of ckb that also uh
7:41
joins and uses advantages of the nervous
7:43
ecosystem and allows to open these
7:46
offchain channels for ckb and RGB Plus+
7:48
assets apart from that it also has
7:50
onchain contracts leveraging the nervos
7:53
capabilities to mitigate this
7:55
counterparty risk and has m a variety of
7:58
multi-asset support and the best part is
8:01
that it's
8:02
interoperable with the lightning Network
8:04
payment channels which will create a
8:06
wide range of assets um activity
8:10
available so having that said uh we are
8:13
getting to a point now then again I
8:15
think us blockchain user experience was
8:19
quite solved or being uh significantly
8:21
solved for single networks but now if we
8:24
want to provide layer one layer two
8:28
swaps uh messaging between chains and
8:30
assets that's another nightmare and for
8:33
the end User it's very difficult that's
8:34
being used and I think the work that
8:36
Bitcoin lining fiber Network are doing
8:38
it's fantastic but if it will be a mess
8:41
if all this work and talent it's not
8:43
being put in in front of the people and
8:46
people can use and use the advantages
8:48
that this create right so there is a
8:50
couple of best practices that we've
8:53
observed uh to build um customer
8:57
interfaces whether you're are building a
8:58
the app a wallet in in our case we are
9:00
building a wallet but that you can use
9:03
in order to facilitate that and first of
9:05
all it's consistent user
9:08
experience um you want to still simplify
9:11
it on boarding processes uh all the
9:13
people here that has a the app know that
9:15
every single extra click you put on the
9:17
on boarding it's a percentage of users
9:20
loss so you want to keep a small
9:22
percentage of clicks needs to be made
9:25
but at the same time you want to provide
9:27
a some minimum amount of guide or
9:29
tutorial on how to use the app so people
9:31
gets comfortable that's something that's
9:33
always there then what you want to do if
9:36
you have multiple chains and layers it's
9:38
to provide as Max as maximum as possible
9:40
unified design language you want to T
9:43
the same uh visual style for all the
9:47
chains so if you are doing a transaction
9:49
you have to display it and show it in
9:50
the same way whether it's happening in
9:52
layer one in Layer Two if it's in in
9:55
whatever Network so people feel
9:57
comfortable and knowing what action they
9:59
perer chains are allowing you to perform
10:01
similar actions in a different way and
10:03
you can talk a unified experience
10:06
language and same with inter
10:07
interactions every time that there is a
10:08
transaction and you have to do a popup a
10:12
confirmation Etc you can do that through
10:14
all the different chains I think that's
10:15
that's very important second of all it's
10:18
applying some kind of chain abstraction
10:21
um principles in design so for example
10:25
seamless specifics in in in each part
10:27
but as as much aggregated context you
10:29
can provide the better uh same with
10:32
wallets that's pretty obvious but if if
10:33
you had gone to this nightmare of
10:35
creating and on boarding and creating a
10:38
wallet you don't want them to have
10:40
different applications and even in the
10:42
same application different keys for for
10:44
each Network so you want to provide a
10:46
single neonic and then derivate that
10:49
with the different algorithms and the
10:51
different networks to provide the single
10:53
Key Management otherwise it will be very
10:55
difficult for the user in terms of
10:58
adaptative design I I think you know the
11:00
pretty basic but transaction
11:02
transparency uh what users want to know
11:04
is how much fees they are paying how
11:06
much time they need to wait so if you
11:09
are especially using different networks
11:10
it may be that the time for completing
11:13
an uh payment channel uh on on a layer
11:16
or two it's less than 1 second in
11:19
another Network it's 2 minutes always
11:21
provide What's the total aggregated
11:22
number of time maybe you can provide
11:24
some small details but that's an
11:26
important part and we believe that
11:28
mobile first it's also very important
11:30
it's I think already mobile it's
11:33
extremely big percentage of all the
11:35
blockchain usage and traffic it's even
11:38
increasing so whether you are providing
11:40
a native mobile or not at least provide
11:43
a responsive that design that it's
11:46
adaptive to all the screens and sizes
11:48
otherwise uh it will be very difficult
11:50
for users to use and last but not least
11:53
a standardization as much
11:55
interoperability you have uh between
11:57
these networks as a standards the better
12:00
so for example if someone here is
12:02
familiar with the cosmos ecosystem there
12:04
is hundreds of chains all these chains
12:06
are based on Cosmos SDK and all of them
12:08
has IBC enabled which is the the
12:12
interoperability protocol so having that
12:15
you can use applications with just
12:16
Kepler which is one of the main wallets
12:18
in the ecosystem that allows you to
12:19
interact with 100 different chains in an
12:22
aggregated portfolio and it's a very
12:24
seamless interaction and it doesn't
12:25
matter if this number of chain is
12:27
increasing the usability is always is
12:29
the same so as and this is only possible
12:31
because IBC just standardized with all
12:33
of them so I think that's very important
12:35
same with Bridges and also with
12:37
identities if we can share identities
12:39
across different networks that's better
12:40
for example here we have did if the uh
12:44
it's recognizable and usable in all
12:46
layers in all networks you can have a
12:48
single d That's a a very good way to
12:51
provide a unique user
12:53
experience so to finish my talk I will
12:56
uh briefly explain how we are
12:58
approaching this from pist on building
13:00
CK bull ckb was uh one of the first
13:04
mobile wallets native for Theos
13:06
ecosystem we started about two years ago
13:09
and our initial approach was testing
13:12
everything on the nervos network we've
13:13
seen that it was quite difficult to
13:15
interact as a user to get a wallet set
13:18
up in your mobile and start interacting
13:20
with the ecosystem so we've built a
13:22
mobile F self- custodial wallet uh with
13:25
the user Centric interface and then we
13:27
provided access to all the nervous Fe
13:29
features in a very easy way to to to do
13:31
it so it's still available you can
13:33
download on Google Play and app store
13:35
it's seeable wallet and then you will
13:37
see that this provides a a quite easy to
13:40
use interface last year we wanted to
13:42
raise the bar a little bit uh we've seen
13:44
that the experience for developers was
13:47
also very difficult you need to uh build
13:49
everything from scratch so we added
13:52
signer app Feature to the to the wallet
13:55
so then you can connect and you can do
13:57
signning with K bu similar as signning
14:00
with metamask which basically allows you
14:03
as a builder to don't worry about Keys
14:06
just create your application and then
14:08
adding this connection button and then
14:10
users can sign transactions and uh uh
14:13
log in and um identify themselves
14:16
through that par we also built an uh a
14:19
built-in on RAM which helps new people
14:22
that if they need to go find an exchange
14:24
register deposit purchase ckb you you
14:27
lost 99% of them
14:29
so if you have one click in the same app
14:31
that you can access some CBS to start
14:34
using the ecosystem that's a far better
14:37
conversion uh we also integrated the ID
14:40
as identity and we are constantly add uh
14:43
adding address support nfts new token
14:46
standard so in a single layer so it's
14:48
easy for users but it's it's very
14:50
accessible so what's next what's next
14:52
for CK bu so what we are working now is
14:55
trying to embrace this multi-chain wall
14:58
and all this innov ations that are
14:59
happening in the ecosystem mostly lead
15:01
by the ckb eone so basically uh CK bu is
15:05
going to be refactored to become a
15:07
multi-chain wallet that Embraces all
15:09
this Innovation following these
15:11
principles where we can support nervos
15:13
network but we also can support fber
15:15
network we can support Bitcoin lining
15:17
Network we can support interoperability
15:20
between both chains and uh we apply
15:23
these chain abstraction techniques that
15:25
I mentioned before to provide or trying
15:27
to provide the best interface for users
15:29
to put this technology that was now in a
15:32
more underlying way and behind the
15:34
scenes to put it available for all the
15:36
people to use it so that's our plans and
15:38
we will be working hard and we are
15:39
committed to do it for the next year so
15:43
that's the presentation I'm happy to
15:45
take any questions if there is time or
15:46
otherwise outside and thank you guys for
15:48
joining
15:49
